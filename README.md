Climate Communication Project for ATM S 321 at University of Washington

Brief:
_There is significant confusion among the general public about climate science. Each student in ATM S 321 is required to do a mini-project to share what they've learned with the public. Options include editing an article on wikipedia (with proper citations of course), posting an educational video on youtube (e.g., a description of an important plot, a whiteboard derivation, or a simulation), or writing a blog entry. Or be creative and think of your own platform! The project should be short in scope (e.g., keep videos under 3 minutes), but should have impeccable scientific accuracy. Don't necessarily limit the complexity of the content (it's OK to use math or assume physics knowledge)._
