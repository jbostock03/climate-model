## Brief
_There is significant confusion among the general public about climate science. Each student in ATM S 321 is required to do a mini-project to share what they've learned with the public. Options include editing an article on wikipedia (with proper citations of course), posting an educational video on youtube (e.g., a description of an important plot, a whiteboard derivation, or a simulation), or writing a blog entry. Or be creative and think of your own platform! The project should be short in scope (e.g., keep videos under 3 minutes), but should have impeccable scientific accuracy. Don't necessarily limit the complexity of the content (it's OK to use math or assume physics knowledge)._


## Introduction
This interactive notebook is designed to explain key concepts in climate science by exploring how insolation drives Earth's energy budget. Included are code, plots, and embedded animations that help visualise some fundamental processes:
- Earth's emission temperature and how this differs to its observed temperature
- How Earth's reflectivity (albedo) influences its temperature
- The surface temperature of the land and oceans over time
- The seasonal and latitudinal variation in incoming solar radiation

The notebook allows users to experiment with albedo, latitude, and time of year to understand how sensitive the climate system is to these parameters.
